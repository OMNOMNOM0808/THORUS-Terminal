# TankWork

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.5.0--alpha-orange)

## Overview
TankWork is an open-source desktop agent framework that enables AI to perceive and control your computer through computer vision and system-level interactions. Agents can:

* Control your computer directly through voice or text commands
* Process real-time screen content using computer vision and expert skill routing
* Interact through natural language voice commands and text input
* Provide continuous audio-visual feedback and action logging
* Switch seamlessly between assistant and computer control modes

Built for developers and researchers working on autonomous desktop agents, TankWork combines advanced computer vision, voice processing, and system control to create AI agents that can truly understand, analyze, and interact with computer interfaces.
